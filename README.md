# Brain-Stoke-Detection-ConvLSTM
This project uses a Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) model to detect Ischemic and Hemorrhagic strokes from MRI scans. Key tasks include developing the model, analyzing MRI data, creating a user-friendly UI, and integrating additional datasets from an NGO. The goal is to improve early stroke detection for timely diagnosis and treatment.
